Whispering is an open-source web app designed to streamline your voice-to-text experience, increasing your writing productivity and simplifying your workflow. By leveraging the OpenAI Whisperer API, Whispering allows you to record your voice, transcribe it instantly, and copy the resulting text directly to your clipboard for seamless pasting into your writing.

## Why Choose Whispering?

Whispering was born from the frustrations of a tedious dictation process that involved visiting the official OpenAI website, clicking multiple buttons for each recording, and manually copying and pasting transcriptions. With Whispering, you can enjoy the following benefits:

- **Save Time**: Eliminate manual transcribing and excessive button clicks. Record, transcribe, and paste with just two clicks.
- **Boost Productivity**: With fewer button clicks and context switching, Whispering increases your writing output, making it perfect for blog posts, essays, or writing prompts.
- **Simplify Workflows**: Effortlessly record, stop, and paste transcribed text with just a few keystrokes.
