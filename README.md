## About

Whispering is a free and open source transcription app. Bring your own API key from providers like OpenAI, Groq, or ElevenLabs, and pay only cents per hour instead of monthly subscriptions. Or use a local transcription service like `Speaches`, which keeps everything on-device. Your audio goes directly to your chosen service—no middleman, no tracking, no data collection.

> We believe transcription should be accessible to everyone. Essential productivity tools shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or closed source code. With Whispering, you own your data, you audit the code, and you control your privacy.

## Why Whispering Wins

### Your Data, Your Control
- **Direct API connections** - Your audio never touches our servers
- **Local storage** - All recordings stay on your device
- **Open source** - Audit the code yourself
- **No telemetry** - We don't even know you're using it
- **Multiple providers** - Choose from OpenAI, Groq, ElevenLabs, or local transcription
- **Pay your provider directly** - No subscription middleman, no markup

### Actual Cost Comparison
| Model | Cost per Hour | Monthly (1 hr/day) | Competitors |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Distil Whispering (Groq) | $0.02 | $0.60 | $5-30/month |
| Whisper Large V3 Turbo | $0.04 | $1.20 | $5-30/month |
| Whisper Large V3 | $0.111 | $3.33 | $5-30/month |

*You pay your chosen provider directly. No subscriptions, no markup.*

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the app for your platform
2. **Add your API key** (OpenAI, Groq, or others) or **configure your local transcription server**
3. **Press** `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + ;` to transcribe anywhere (and configure more in settings)

That's it. We don't charge you (only your API provider does). No credit card. No subscription. No tracking.

### The Complete Setup Guide

Need more details? Here's everything you need to know:

#### Step 1: Install Whispering
Choose your platform and [download the app](#installation). The desktop app is recommended for global transcription support.

#### Step 2: Configure Your Transcription Service & API Key

1. Open Whispering
2. Navigate to **Settings** (⚙️) → **Transcription**
3. Select your transcription service from the dropdown
4. Add your API key for the chosen service
   - **Recommended**: Start with [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) for fastest & cheapest transcription (`distil-whisper-large-v3-en` is lightning fast and $0.02 / hour as of 06-30-2025)
   - **Alternative**: Use Speaches for local transcription and complete privacy (no API key needed)

#### Step 3: Start Transcribing!
- **Quick access**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + ;` anywhere on your desktop
- **In-app**: Click the large microphone button
- **Hands-free**: Enable Voice Activity Detection (VAD) mode

Your transcription will be automatically copied to clipboard and ready to paste!

#### Optional: Step 4: Configure Transformations
Enhance your transcriptions with AI-powered post-processing by creating custom workflows:

**Creating a Transformation Workflow:**
1. Navigate to **Transformations** (📚) in the main navigation
2. Click "Create Transformation" 
3. Give your workflow a title (e.g., "Format")

**Configuring Step 1: Prompt Transform**
1. Add a new step and select **"Prompt Transform"**
2. Choose your AI model profile (e.g., **"Google Gemini 2.5 Flash"**)
3. Configure your prompts using dynamic injection:

   **System Prompt Example:**
   ```
   You are a professional text formatter. Format the following transcribed text for clarity and readability.
   ```

   **User Prompt Example:**
   ```
   Please format this transcription: {{input}}
   
   Requirements:
   - Fix capitalization and punctuation
   - Break into logical paragraphs
   - Maintain original meaning
   ```

**How Prompt Injection Works:**
- The `{{input}}` placeholder dynamically receives your transcribed text
- When the workflow runs, `{{input}}` is replaced with the actual transcription
- The complete prompt (with injected content) is sent to Google Gemini 2.5 Flash
- The AI processes your text according to the instructions and returns the formatted result

**Chaining Multiple Steps:**
Create complex workflows by adding more transformation steps:
- **Step 1:** Prompt Transform (Format with Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Step 2:** Find & Replace (Remove filler words like "um", "uh")  
- **Step 3:** Prompt Transform (Translate to Spanish with GPT-4)

Each step receives the output from the previous step as its `{{input}}`.

**Note:** Additional AI provider API keys may be needed ([see providers](#api-key-providers))

### How is my data stored?

Whispering stores as much data as possible locally on your device, including recordings and text transcriptions. This approach ensures maximum privacy and data security. Here's an overview of how data is handled:

1. **Local Storage**: Voice recordings and transcriptions are stored in IndexedDB, which is used as blob storage and a place to store all of your data like text and transcriptions.

2. **Transcription Service**: The only data sent elsewhere is your recording to an external transcription service—if you choose one. You have the following options:
   - External services like OpenAI, Groq, or ElevenLabs (with your own API keys)
   - A local transcription service such as Speaches, which keeps everything on-device

3. **Transformation Service (Optional)**: Whispering includes configurable transformation settings that allow you to pipe transcription output into custom transformation flows. These flows can leverage:
   - External Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, or Groq's Llama models
   - Hosted LLMs within your custom workflows for advanced text processing
   - Simple find-and-replace operations for basic text modifications
   
   When using AI-powered transformations, your transcribed text is sent to your chosen LLM provider using your own API key. All transformation configurations, including prompts and step sequences, are stored locally in your settings.

You can change both the transcription and transformation services in the settings to ensure maximum local functionality and privacy.

#### Architecture Patterns
- Service Layer: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- Query Layer: Reactive data management with caching
- RPC Pattern: Unified API interface (`rpc.recordings.getAllRecordings`)
- Dependency Injection: Clean separation of concerns

### Architecture Deep Dive

#### Three-Layer Architecture
```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│  UI Layer   │ --> │  Query Layer│ --> │ Service Layer│
│ (Svelte 5)  │     │ (TanStack)  │     │   (Pure)     │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      ↑                    │
      └────────────────────┘
         Reactive Updates
```

#### Key Patterns

Service Layer (`/lib/services/`):
- Platform-agnostic business logic
- Result types for error handling
- Dependency injection for cross-platform support

Query Layer (`/lib/query/`):
- TanStack Query integration
- Reactive state management
- Caching and optimistic updates
- Unified RPC interface

RPC Pattern:
```typescript
import { rpc } from '$lib/query';

// Reactive usage in components
const recordings = createQuery(rpc.recordings.getAllRecordings.options);

// Imperative usage in actions
const { data, error } = await rpc.transcription.transcribe.execute(blob);
```

### Run Whispering in Local Development Mode

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/braden-w/whispering.git`
2. Change into the project directory: `cd whispering`
3. Install the necessary dependencies: `pnpm i`

To run the desktop app and website:
```bash
cd apps/app
pnpm tauri dev
```

To run the Chrome extension (once it's restored):
```bash
cd apps/extension
pnpm dev --target=chrome-mv3
```

### Build The Executable Yourself

If you have concerns about the installers or want more control, you can build the executable yourself. This requires more setup, but it ensures that you are running the code you expect. Such is the beauty of open-source software!

#### Desktop

```bash
cd apps/app
pnpm i
pnpm tauri build
```

Find the executable in `apps/app/target/release`

#### Firefox Extension
```bash
cd apps/extension
pnpm i
pnpm plasmo build --target=firefox-mv3
```
Output in `apps/extension/build/firefox-mv3-prod`
