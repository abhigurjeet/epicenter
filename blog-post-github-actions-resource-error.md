# The Simple Fix for "Resource not accessible by integration" in GitHub Actions

I recently spent several hours debugging a frustrating GitHub Actions error while setting up automated releases for my Tauri application. The error message was cryptic and sent me down multiple rabbit holes before I discovered the embarrassingly simple solution.

## The Error

```
Couldn't find release with tag v7.0.0. Creating one.
Error: Resource not accessible by integration - https://docs.github.com/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release
```

## What I Tried (The Wrong Path)

Like many developers, I immediately assumed this was a permissions issue. I spent hours:

- ✅ Checking repository settings for "Read and write permissions"
- ✅ Adding explicit `contents: write` permissions to my workflow
- ✅ Testing the GitHub API manually with curl (which worked perfectly)
- ✅ Adding comprehensive debugging steps to test token scopes
- ❌ All of this was unnecessary!

## The Real Problem

The issue wasn't permissions at all. I had created a git tag locally and pushed it to GitHub, but I **forgot to push my local main branch changes first**. 

The tag was pointing to a commit that existed locally but not on the remote repository. When tauri-action tried to create a release for that commit, GitHub couldn't find it, hence the "resource not accessible" error.

## The Simple Solution

```bash
# Push your changes to main first
git push origin main

# Then push your tag
git push origin v7.0.0
```

That's it. No permission changes needed, no workflow modifications required.

## Why This Happens

GitHub Actions workflows triggered by tags need the underlying commit to exist on the remote repository. If you:

1. Make local commits
2. Create a tag locally
3. Push the tag without pushing the commits
4. Trigger a workflow that tries to create a release

The workflow will fail because it's referencing a commit that doesn't exist on the remote.

## Key Takeaway

Before debugging complex permission issues with GitHub Actions, always ensure your repository state is synchronized:

```bash
git status                    # Check for unpushed commits
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD  # See commits ahead of remote
git push origin main          # Push commits first
git push origin --tags        # Then push tags
```

Sometimes the simplest explanation is the correct one. A classic case of looking for a complex solution to a simple problem!

## For Future Reference

If you encounter "Resource not accessible by integration" errors:

1. **First**: Check if your local branch is ahead of the remote
2. **Second**: Verify the commit your tag points to exists on GitHub
3. **Last resort**: Check permissions and API access

This simple check could save you hours of debugging complex permission configurations.
