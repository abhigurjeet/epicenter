# Svelte 5 Runes Migration for Tab Manager

## Overview
Update the tab manager app from Svelte 4 syntax to Svelte 5's new runes syntax.

## Current State
- Counter.svelte uses `let count: number = 0` for reactive state
- Traditional event handlers with `on:click`
- No use of runes ($state, $derived, etc.)

## Migration Plan

### Todo Items
- [x] Update Counter.svelte to use $state rune
- [x] Check if App.svelte needs any rune updates
- [x] Verify the app still works after migration
- [x] Update any other Svelte files if found

## Changes Needed

### Counter.svelte
- Replace `let count: number = 0` with `let count = $state(0)`
- Keep the increment function as-is (arrow functions are still valid)
- Event handlers remain the same (`on:click` is still the correct syntax)

### App.svelte
- Check for any reactive state that needs migration
- Currently appears to be mostly static content

## Notes
- Svelte 5 runes are opt-in, but recommended for new code
- $state() creates reactive state
- $derived() creates computed values
- $effect() replaces reactive statements
- Event handlers (`on:click`) remain unchanged from Svelte 4

## Review

### Changes Made
1. **Counter.svelte**: Updated to use `$state(0)` instead of `let count: number = 0`
   - The type annotation was removed as TypeScript can infer the type from the initial value
   - The increment function and event handler syntax remain unchanged

2. **App.svelte**: No changes needed - contains only static imports and markup

### Summary
Successfully migrated the tab manager app to Svelte 5 runes syntax. The migration was minimal as only the Counter component had reactive state. The app maintains full compatibility while adopting the new reactive primitives.
