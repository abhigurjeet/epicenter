# Whispering v7.0.0 - Faster, Smarter, More Reliable

Whispering v7.0.0 represents the biggest rewrite in the project's entire history. We've completely rebuilt the application from the ground up, touching nearly every line of code to deliver a faster, more reliable, and more maintainable experience.

This is a complete architectural overhaul that makes everything better. The UI responds more quickly to your actions. Errors are clearer and recover automatically. The new visual shortcut recorder shows your key combinations in real-time. And with support for local transcription through Speaches, you can now use Whispering completely offline without any API keys.

The numbers tell the story: 495 files changed, with a net reduction of over 10,000 lines of code through better organization. But what you'll notice is how much smoother everything feels.
