## 🔥 **Complete TanStack Query Integration**

The biggest change in v7.0.0 is the ground-up rewrite using **TanStack Query** for all data management. This isn't just a dependency swap—it's a complete architectural transformation.

### What is TanStack Query?
TanStack Query is the industry-leading data synchronization library that provides:
- **Intelligent caching** - Data is cached automatically and reused across components
- **Background refetching** - Keeps your data fresh without user intervention
- **Optimistic updates** - UI responds immediately to user actions
- **Error handling** - Comprehensive error states and retry logic
- **Request deduplication** - Multiple components requesting the same data trigger only one network request

**Note**: We're using a custom fork of TanStack Query optimized for Svelte 5 compatibility. We also made an internal `_utils` file that gives us query/mutation option factories, direct query/mutations without subscriptions, and enhanced Result type handling.

### The New Query Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│     UI      │ --> │    Query    │ --> │   Services   │
│ Components  │     │    Layer    │     │    (Pure)    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      ↑                    │
      └────────────────────┘
         Reactive Updates
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Dual Interface**: Every operation supports both reactive (UI) and imperative (actions) usage
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with `Result<T, E>` types for error handling
- **Automatic Caching**: Data is cached intelligently and shared across components
- **Settings Integration**: Queries automatically react to settings changes
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI feels instant with automatic rollback on errors

### Example: Before vs After

**Before (v6.5.0):**
```typescript
// Multiple places doing direct service calls
const recordings = await db.getAllRecordings();
// Manual loading states, error handling, caching
```

**After (v7.0.0):**
```typescript
// Reactive in components
const recordings = createQuery(rpc.recordings.getAllRecordings.options());

// Imperative in actions
const { data, error } = await rpc.recordings.deleteRecording.execute(recordingId);
```

## 🏗️ **Complete Service Layer Rewrite**

### New Service Architecture

The service layer has been completely restructured with a focus on:

1. **Platform Abstraction**: Clean separation between desktop, web, and extension implementations
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected based on platform detection
3. **Pure Functions**: All services are pure functions with no side effects
4. **Result Types**: Migrated from `@epicenterhq/result` to `wellcrafted` library for consistent error handling
5. **Parameter Passing**: Services now accept explicit parameters (e.g., apiKey) instead of hidden dependencies
6. **RPC Layer**: New RPC layer for better separation of concerns between UI and services

### Service Categories

**Core Services:**
- `ClipboardService` - Platform-agnostic clipboard operations
- `NotificationService` - Cross-platform notifications
- `RecordingDbService` - Data persistence layer
- `TranscriptionService` - Audio-to-text conversion
- `RegisterShortcutsService` - Global and local keyboard shortcuts

**Implementation Strategy:**
- `*ServiceDesktopLive.ts` - Tauri/desktop implementations
- `*ServiceWebLive.ts` - Browser implementations
- `*ServiceExtensionLive.ts` - Chrome extension implementations

### Example Service Implementation

```typescript
// Clean interface definition
type ClipboardService = {
  writeText: (text: string) => Promise<Result<void, ClipboardError>>;
  readText: () => Promise<Result<string, ClipboardError>>;
};

// Platform-specific implementations
const ClipboardServiceDesktopLive: ClipboardService = {
  writeText: (text) => writeText(text), // Tauri API
};

const ClipboardServiceWebLive: ClipboardService = {
  writeText: (text) => navigator.clipboard.writeText(text), // Web API
};
```
