# Whispering v7.0.0 - Complete Architecture Rewrite

## 🚀 Major Release Highlights

Whispering v7.0.0 represents the most significant architectural overhaul in the project's history. This release completely rewrites the application's data layer, service architecture, and UI foundations to deliver a more robust, maintainable, and performant experience.

**Impact by the Numbers:**
- 495 files changed
- 24,438 lines added
- 35,353 lines removed
- Net reduction of 10,915 lines through better code organization

## 🔥 **Complete TanStack Query Integration**

The biggest change in v7.0.0 is the ground-up rewrite using **TanStack Query** for all data management. TanStack Query is the industry-leading asynchronous state manager that provides: intelligent caching, background refetching, optimistic updates, and comprehensive error handling.

**Note**: We're using a custom fork optimized for Svelte 5 compatibility with enhanced Result type handling from the **wellcrafted** library.

### The New Query Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│     UI      │ --> │    Query    │ --> │   Services   │
│ Components  │     │    Layer    │     │    (Pure)    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────────┘
      ↑                    │
      └────────────────────┘
         Reactive Updates
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Dual Interface**: Every operation supports both reactive (UI) and imperative (actions) usage
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with `Result<T, E>` types for error handling
- **Automatic Caching**: Data is cached intelligently and shared across components
- **Settings Integration**: Queries automatically react to settings changes
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI feels instant with automatic rollback on errors

### Example: Before vs After

**Before (v6.5.0):**
```typescript
// Multiple places doing direct service calls
const recordings = await db.getAllRecordings();
// Manual loading states, error handling, caching
```

**After (v7.0.0):**
```typescript
// Reactive in components
const recordings = createQuery(rpc.recordings.getAllRecordings.options());

// Imperative in actions
const { data, error } = await rpc.recordings.deleteRecording.execute(recordingId);
```

## 🏗️ **Complete Service Layer Rewrite**

The service layer acts as the bridge between the UI and external systems (APIs, databases, file system, etc.). Think of it as the "business logic" layer that handles all the heavy lifting while keeping the UI components clean and focused on presentation.

### New Service Architecture

The service layer has been completely restructured with platform abstraction (desktop/web/extension), dependency injection, pure functions, and consistent error handling using the **wellcrafted** library. Services now accept explicit parameters instead of hidden dependencies, with a new RPC layer for clean UI-service separation.

## **Key UI Improvements**
