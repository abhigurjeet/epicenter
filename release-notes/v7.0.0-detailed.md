## Architecture Changes

### Three-Layer Architecture

We've adopted a clean three-layer architecture that enables extensive code sharing between desktop and web:

```
UI Layer (Svelte 5) → Query Layer (TanStack) → Service Layer (Pure Functions)
```

- **Service Layer**: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- **Query Layer**: Adds reactivity and caching on top of services
- **UI Layer**: Thin components that use the unified `rpc.*` interface

### Key Technical Improvements
- TanStack Query integration (custom Svelte 5 fork)
- WellCrafted Result types for error handling
- Pure static builds (no SSR)
- Unified RPC pattern for all operations
- Build-time platform detection
