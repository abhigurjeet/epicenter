I code hands-free while managing 6 AI agents in parallel - here's my $0.02/hour workflow

## Post Content

Hey r/productivity!

I've completely changed how I work by talking to my computer hands-free. I can now code while walking around, cooking, or just thinking out loud. It sounds crazy but it actually works.

Here's what happened: I was getting terrible wrist pain from typing all day. Started looking into voice transcription apps but they all wanted $30/month. Did the math and realized they're just charging 10x markup on API calls that cost pennies.

So I built Whispering - a free, open-source transcription app where you bring your own API key. Costs me about $0.02/hour for heavy use. The game changer is voice-activated mode - I just talk and it transcribes. No clicking, no shortcuts while I'm speaking.

Now I code by explaining what I want to build out loud. I paste the transcription into my AI coding assistant and it just works. I'm literally managing 6 different coding tasks in parallel just by talking through each one. It's like having a conversation with myself but productive.

The productivity gains are real: no context switching between thinking and typing, ideas captured at the speed of thought, and my wrists don't hurt anymore. Plus I can pace around while working which keeps me energized.

The video shows my actual workflow - you can see how natural it feels once you get used to it.
