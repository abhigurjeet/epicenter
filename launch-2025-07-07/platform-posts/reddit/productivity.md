Title: I built a completely free, open-source alternative to paid transcription apps

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share Whispering, a transcription app I built that's completely free and open source. I was frustrated seeing basic transcription tools charging monthly subscriptions for what should be a simple utility.

**What makes it different:**
- 100% free forever - no premium tiers, no limits
- You bring your own API key (OpenAI Whisper, Groq, etc.)
- Your audio never touches our servers - direct API calls only
- Fully open source - audit the code yourself
- Works on Mac, Windows, and Linux

**Why I built this:**
I've been using it daily for months before I even knew paid alternatives existed. When I discovered companies charging $15-30/month for what's essentially an API wrapper, I decided to open source my tool.

**Real costs:**
- Groq's Whisper: ~$0.02/hour
- OpenAI's Whisper: ~$0.10-0.18/hour
- Your actual usage: probably $2-10/month vs $30/month subscriptions

I believe essential productivity tools should be accessible to everyone. Transcription shouldn't be gatekept behind monthly fees.

**Privacy first:**
With your own API key, you have complete control. The app makes direct calls to your chosen service. No middleman, no data collection, no tracking. It's all open source so you can verify this yourself.

I'd love to hear your feedback and how you use transcription in your workflow!
