# Twitter/X Launch Strategy

## Primary Launch Thread (Workflow Angle with Video)

### Tweet 1 (Hook + Video)
I haven't typed code in 3 months.

Here's my setup that costs $0.02/hour:

### Tweet 2 (The Reveal + Link)
It's called @WhisperingApp - a completely free, open-source transcription tool I built.

While others charge $30/month, you just bring your own API key and pay cents directly to providers.

### Tweet 3 (The Philosophy)
I built this for myself before knowing competitors existed.

When I discovered they charge monthly subscriptions for what's basically an API wrapper, I knew I had to open source it.

### Tweet 4 (Technical Details + Setup Guide)
Built with:
- Svelte 5 (production runes example)
- Tauri (50MB, instant startup)
- Your choice of API (OpenAI, Groq)

No servers. No tracking. Just your voice â†’ your code.

### Tweet 5 (Call to Action)
Try the voice coding workflow:
1. Download Whispering (free, open source)
2. Add your API key (Groq is $0.02/hour)
3. Turn on voice activation
4. Start talking to your code

Built with @sveltejs 5 + @tauri_apps. The communities that helped me build this.

## Alternative: Pure Tool Thread (If Video Doesn't Perform)

### Tweet 1 (Problem/Solution Hook)
Transcription apps charging $30/month for API wrappers is insane.

So I built a free, open-source alternative where you bring your own API key.

A thread on why transcription should be free ðŸ§µ

### Tweet 2 (The Math + Link)
The math:
- Competitors: $30/month
- Actual API cost: $0.02-0.18/hour
- Your savings: 99%+

Whispering is 100% free and open source.

### Tweet 3 (How It Works)
How it works:
1. Download Whispering (Mac/Windows/Linux)
2. Add your API key (OpenAI, Groq, etc)
3. Start transcribing

Your audio â†’ Your chosen API â†’ You
No middleman. No markup. No BS.

### Tweet 4 (The Story)
I've been using this daily for 6 months (3-4 hours/day).

My total cost? About $3/month going directly to Groq.

If I used a competitor? $30/month for the exact same API calls.

### Tweet 5 (The Philosophy)
I believe essential tools should be:
- Free to use
- Open to inspect
- Yours to control

No subscriptions. No limits. No data collection.
Just transcription as it should be.

## Video-First Strategy (RECOMMENDED)

### Why Video First?
- Shows the magic moment (voice â†’ code)
- 3 minutes is perfect for Twitter video
- Demonstrates value immediately
- Higher engagement than text

### Optimal Posting Strategy
1. **9:00 AM PST**: Post video thread
2. **Monitor for 1 hour**: Check engagement
3. **If viral**: Keep pushing with quote tweets
4. **If flat**: Try text thread at 2 PM PST

### Key Twitter/X Optimizations
- âœ… Link in second tweet (avoids algorithm penalty)
- âœ… Video in first tweet (maximum engagement)
- âœ… Thread format (more surface area)
- âœ… Clear CTA in final tweet
- âœ… @ mention relevant accounts (@sveltejs, @tauri_apps)

## Follow-up Tweets (Next 24-48 Hours)

### If Video Goes Viral:
"Update: 10K developers tried the voice coding workflow in 24 hours.

Most common reaction: 'Why was I typing all this time?'

If you missed it: [link to original thread]"

### Testimonial Amplification:
"Someone just DM'd me: 'I canceled my $30/month subscription and saved $300/year'

This is why I open sourced Whispering.

Transcription should be free."

### Technical Deep Dive:
"For the devs asking about the Svelte 5 implementation:
