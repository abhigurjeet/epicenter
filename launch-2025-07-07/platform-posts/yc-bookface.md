Built a free alternative to $30/month transcription apps - looking for feedback

## Post Content

Hey YC,

I built Whispering after discovering transcription apps charge $15-30/month for what's essentially an API wrapper. 

**The numbers:**
- Competitors: $15-30/month ($180-360/year)
- Whispering: Free + API costs (~$0.02-0.18/hour)
- My usage: 3-4 hours daily = ~$2-5/month vs $30/month

**What it is:**
- Open-source desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux)
- Bring your own API key (OpenAI, Groq, etc.)
- Direct API calls, no middleman
- Built with Svelte 5 + Tauri

**Traction:**
- Personal use: 6 months, daily
- Early users: ~50 developers from my network
- Use case: Voice coding, meeting notes, content creation

**Why I'm sharing:**
1. Validate the philosophy: Should essential tools be free/open?
2. Understand the market: Are people willing to self-host for 90% savings?
3. Get feedback on positioning: Tool vs. workflow enabler?

**Interesting discovery:**
I've been using it with Claude Code for voice-driven development. Completely changed how I code - 3x faster for certain tasks. Not sure if this workflow angle is more compelling than the cost savings.

Would love thoughts on:
- Is "bring your own API key" too technical for mainstream?
- Should I focus on the tool or the workflow it enables?
- Any similar "de-SaaS-ification" successes you've seen?
