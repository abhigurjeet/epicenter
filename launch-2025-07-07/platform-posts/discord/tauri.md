Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Just launched **Whispering** - a free, open-source transcription app built with Tauri + Svelte 5.

**What it does:**
Real-time transcription using your own API keys (OpenAI Whisper, Groq, etc). No subscriptions, no limits.

**Tauri highlights:**
- System tray with global shortcuts
- Secure API key storage
- 50MB bundle size
- Native audio processing
- Cross-platform (Mac/Win/Linux)

**Cool features:**
- Overlay mode for transcribing over other apps
- Custom IPC for audio streaming
- Auto-updater built in

Would love feedback from the Tauri community! Happy to answer any implementation questions ðŸš€
