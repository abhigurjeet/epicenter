Yo Vibe Coders! ðŸŽ¯

Just dropped something that changed my entire coding workflow. I haven't typed code in 3 months.

**The setup:**
- Whispering (my open-source transcription app) in voice-activated mode
- Groq's Whisper API (stupid fast, like instant)
- Claude Code in the IDE
- Cost: 2 cents per hour (not a typo)

**How it works:**
I literally just talk about what I want to build. Whispering transcribes it instantly, Claude Code turns it into actual code. It's like pair programming with yourself but way more efficient.

**The vibe shift:**
- No more context switching between thinking and typing
- Flow state hits different when you're just talking
- Built entire features while walking around
- My wrists actually don't hurt anymore

Here's a demo video of me building a full CRUD feature in 3 minutes: [link]

The app is free and open source because I think this workflow should be accessible to everyone. Been using it daily for 6 months.

Who else is ready to stop typing? Let's discuss voice-driven development ðŸŽ¤

P.S. - Yes it works with VS Code, Cursor, whatever you use
