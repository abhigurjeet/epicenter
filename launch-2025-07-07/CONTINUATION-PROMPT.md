# Continuation Prompt for Launch Campaign

## Context
I'm working on launching Whispering across multiple platforms. The launch plan is in `/launch-2025-07-07/LAUNCH-PLAN.md`.

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Reddit r/sveltejs post: https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1ltzyme/show_rsveltejs_whispering_an_production_svelte_5/
- ✅ Reddit r/OpenAI post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lu20tr/i_built_a_free_opensource_app_that_connects/
- ✅ Reddit r/Anthropic post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthropic/comments/1lu29ba/i_manage_6_claude_code_agents_in_parallel_by/

## Next Steps
Please continue with the launch campaign by:

1. Check the LAUNCH-PLAN.md for the next platform to post on
2. Review the corresponding platform post in `/launch-2025-07-07/platform-posts/`
3. Help me prepare and post to that platform
4. After posting, update the file with:
   - Status: ✅ POSTED
   - Posted URL: [the actual URL]
5. Update this continuation prompt with the new completed task

## Important Guidelines
- Always ask for the posted URL after completing a post
- Update the platform post file with the status and URL
- Keep track of all posted URLs for the final summary
- Follow the specific guidelines for each platform (character limits, hashtags, etc.)

## Platform-Specific Notes
- Reddit: Use "Show r/[subreddit]:" format for titles
- Twitter/X: Keep under character limit, use relevant hashtags
- LinkedIn: Professional tone, emphasize business value
- Discord: Casual, developer-focused, emphasize community

Please continue with the next platform in the launch plan!
